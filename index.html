                    <p>
                        Sri Mukkanneshwara Associate was established in February 2021 with the vision of fostering financial cooperation and mutual growth among its members. Starting with 8 initial members, the association has evolved into a well-structured organization with 7 active members. The association maintains a systematic approach to financial management, with each member contributing ₹2,000 monthly, resulting in a total monthly collection of ₹14,000.

                    <h3><i class="fas fa-history"></i> Our Journey</h3>
                    <p>
                        The association's journey began in 2021 with an initial monthly deposit of ₹1,000 per member. Our first annual meeting was conducted at M Thumbaraguddi (Native Place), where we established our core rules and loan procedures. In 2022, we strengthened our foundation by increasing the monthly deposit to ₹1,500 and held our second annual meeting at Sampige Heritage Resort, Koppal. During this phase, we implemented a streamlined loan distribution process and established systematic record-keeping practices.

                    <p>
                        The year 2023 marked a period of growth and stability. We successfully managed multiple active loans and strengthened member relationships through regular meetings. Our third annual meeting was held at Cotton County Club, Hubballi, where we reviewed and enhanced our financial management systems.
